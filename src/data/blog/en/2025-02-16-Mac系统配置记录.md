## System Configuration

### 1. Initial Configuration

- Enable installation from any source: `sudo spctl --master-disable`

- Install software to external drive

  ```bash
  # Create Applications directory on external drive
  mkdir /Volumes/Work/Application
  # Create Library and Application Support directories on external drive
  mkdir -p /Volumes/Work/Library/Application\ Support
  # Move software folders installed in "/Applications" to external drive's Applications directory (manually or via command)
  mv /Applications/A.app /Volumes/Work/Application
  # Enter system's built-in Applications directory
  cd /Applications
  # Link software files back to internal drive
  ln -s /Volumes/Work/Application/A.app ./A.app
  # If software has other necessary files in ~/Library/Application Support, move them to external drive's corresponding directory
  mv ~/Library/Application\ Support/A /Volumes/Work/Library/Application\ Support
  # And create symbolic link
  ln -s /Volumes/Work/Library/Application\ Support/A ~/Library/Application\ Support
  ```

- Remove unnecessary options from login items and extensions

  ```bash
  # Open corresponding folders in Finder, delete files matching login item names
  ~/Library/LaunchAgents
  /Library/LaunchAgents
  /Library/LaunchDaemons
  ```

### 2. Unlimited Trial for Eudic Dictionary

Eudic Dictionary for Mac differs from the Windows version; the Mac version has trial limits without purchasing. However, you can bypass this by modifying local preferences. Here's the detailed process:

- Open Finder
- Use shortcut `Cmd + Shift + G`
- Enter path: `~/Library/Preferences`
- Locate file: `com.eusoft.eudic.plist`
- Open the binary plist file as XML; you can install the Binary Plist plugin in VSCode to open it.
- Find the field: `MAIN_TimesLeft`
- Change its value to a large number (e.g., 99999), then save

Restart Eudic Dictionary, and you can use the professional features unlimited times. Upgrades won't invalidate this.

## Development Configuration

### 1. Python (conda-forge)

#### numpy

- NumPy is optimized via Apple's Accelerate framework (BLAS). When using conda, you need to specify numpy's dependency on the BLAS library. If installing via Wheel from PyPI, numpy>2.0 will automatically use the Accelerate framework's BLAS.

  ```bash
  conda install numpy "blas=*=*accelerate*"
  ```

- You can also switch the environment's BLAS implementation; this command only focuses on the BLAS library itself and won't automatically install other packages that depend on BLAS. If other packages require the BLAS library, install them manually.

  ```bash
  conda install "libblas=*=*accelerate" # New command
  conda install "blas=*=accelerate" # Old command
  ```

- If you want to commit to a specific BLAS implementation, you can pin the BLAS implementation in the environment to prevent conda from falling back. To commit to accelerate, add `libblas=*=*accelerate` to `<conda-root>/envs/<env-name>/conda-meta/pinned` as described in conda-docs.
