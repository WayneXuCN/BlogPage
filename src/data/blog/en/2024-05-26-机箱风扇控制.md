## Ramblings

I never thought my ATX case fans were that noisy before, but after setting up a new ITX mini PC, the ATX one sounds incredibly loud in comparison. Especially when placed next to another mini PC, the one I thought was noisy now seems quiet.

The motherboard's built-in fan control offers two modes: based on motherboard temperature or CPU temperature. But when I set the fan speed to very low at low CPU temps, it didn't seem to work. Maybe the MSI BIOS is just poor, or perhaps my case fans aren't up to par.

When do case fans really need to run at high speed? Usually during heavy GPU load. The motherboard's control relies on its temperature sensors, but the motherboard isn't the primary heat source—it just gets indirectly heated, leading to inaccuracies. Controlling case fan speed based on GPU temperature would be ideal, but the BIOS doesn't allow that.

I found a small software called FanControl on GitHub, which is quite powerful. Here's my experience with it.

## Speed Control

There are three main modules: Controls, Speeds, and Curves.

I fiddled around a bit at first and discovered an issue: my case fans couldn't be controlled by this software, but the CPU fan could. Another problem was that my two case fans were running at full speed (1350 rpm) the whole time—I was shocked. That's why it was so loud. Luckily, I had removed two of the four fans. I checked the fan specs: Arctic F12 3Pin, which has decent reviews, so I didn't buy the wrong ones. But some say they're quiet below 1000 rpm and noisy above that.

Looking closer at the specs, they don't support PWM control. That's why adjusting in BIOS didn't work. I checked the BIOS again, and only one case fan could be set to DC control; the other couldn't be adjusted for some reason. Maybe the connector doesn't support it. After saving the BIOS settings, the outer case fan now supports speed adjustment. Now I can control it as needed.

## Parameter Settings

- **Curves are the speed rules we manually define.** There are no Curves by default. Click the plus button in the bottom right to add a rule—Linear or Graph are easy to configure.
  - Hysteresis and Response time are for sensitivity and response speed—leave them default. Set Temperature source to GPU.
  - I found the Graph-style Curves more intuitive and easier to understand. I set up three levels for the case fans:
    - Low temp stage (CPU/GPU below 40°C): Fan speed 10-20%; Maintain low noise with sufficient cooling for light loads.
    - Medium temp stage (CPU/GPU 40°C to 60°C): Fan speed 20-40%; Suitable for moderate loads like browsing, watching videos, or light gaming, with moderate noise.
    - High temp stage (CPU/GPU above 60°C): Fan speed 40-100%; Provide maximum cooling during high loads (heavy gaming or rendering), with speed increasing non-linearly with temperature for effective control.

- **The boxes in Speeds represent all fans in the system.** By default, they're labeled Fan #1, Fan #2, etc.—you can rename them.
- **Controls link Speeds and Curves.**
  - Click the settings in the top right of Control, then Select matching fan to bind the fan.
  - Control parameters are straightforward: Enable: on/off; Fan curve: speed rule, select the one you configured; Offset: balancing parameter to equalize speeds across multiple fans.

Finally, here's the result of the fan control after adjustments:
