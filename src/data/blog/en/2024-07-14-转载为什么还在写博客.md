> Excerpted from [You should blog even if you have no readers](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/you-should-blog-even-if-you-have-no-readers.html)

Spencer Fry wrote an excellent article about "why entrepreneurs should write." I'd like to add that the benefits of writing go far beyond imagination—even if you have no readers (whether you're an entrepreneur or not), it's still worth blogging.

I now have over 50 unfinished drafts. Some are just random ideas I jot down, recording my internal debates. Most drafts may never be published, but each writing brings me unique value.

### Writing Makes You a Better Reader

Blogging has changed how I read others' work.

In the process of finding suitable structure and expression, I become more attuned to what makes a good argument and what falls short. I'm also better at spotting flaws in others' reasoning.

At the same time, when reading, I'm no longer easily misled by weak counterexamples that superficially refute articles. Almost every article has some counterexamples, which may be based on individual exceptions. Online commentators love to point these out. However, these exceptions often overlook the main point of the article. By understanding the implicit context behind articles, I gain more value from reading.

I also pay more attention to excellent writers' styles. I mentally note how good writers express ideas. I've always liked Paul Graham's articles, but now I appreciate how he organizes them. He has a captivating ability to draw readers into his world, making them see issues from his perspective. I've also learned a lot of good writing techniques from reading Bradford Cross's blog; his articles are clearly structured, with short paragraphs that make reading very smooth.

### Writing Makes You Smarter

Writing reveals flaws in thinking. When your ideas are written down and reviewed, they are far less convincing than in your mind. Writing forces you to mature your views by thinking through counterarguments.

Writing helps organize thoughts more coherently. This makes you a better conversationalist on related topics. I can't count how many times I've had deeper discussions with others because I organized my thoughts through writing beforehand.

### Other Benefits Are Just Bonuses

Other benefits from writing—personal branding, networking, more opportunities—these are just bonuses. Although these can be very significant, they are not the main reason you should write.

You should write because writing makes you a better person.
