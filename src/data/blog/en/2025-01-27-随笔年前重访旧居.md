After three or four years, standing again at the entrance to my old home, the faded Spring Festival couplets still hang on the security door of the old house. The plaster peels off, the air carries a musty smell, as if everything has returned to the past. The neighbor's old lady's little dog Wangwang barks wildly, cooking oil smoke seeps through the window cracks, and the surroundings look so familiar. Only the person standing here is no longer the eighteen-year-old boy who thought the future could be as clear as a textbook.

My fingertips touch the peeling plaster, suddenly remembering that when I moved to the new home three years ago, I didn't take a photo of this house filled with memories. At that time, I was only thinking about rushing to the new life, not knowing that some farewells need ceremony. Unexpectedly, the space that once held twenty years of memories, one day even the mold spots in the corners would become nostalgic. Now I understand why elders always reminisce about the past. It turns out that when ten years of time are compressed into tangible scenes, anyone would become a nagging nostalgic person.

I raise my phone, aiming at that rusty door, in the frame, the sunlight of 2025 intertwines with the dust of 2003. The scratches on the metal lock become clearer, my fingertips lightly touch those grooves of varying depths, only then realizing that these scars record the passage of time more faithfully than any words.

The viewfinder trembles slightly, I see my shadow overlapping with the boy who was spinning his keychain ten years ago. The neighbor's old lady's wok still sizzles, Wangwang's barking breaks the silence of the corridor. In the flickering light and shadow, the inverted "Fu" character on the security door gradually peels off, fragments scatter with the wind. These fragments carrying the smell of oil smoke suddenly become heavy.

It turns out that what proves we have truly lived is not those grand narratives, but the patina on the door handle, the height marks drawn with pencil in the corner, the accumulated dust and rust in the door cracks—these small fragments quietly appear in memory, outlining the contours of time.
